Around this time last year, I was approached by the manager of the [AI class](https://artificial-intelligence-class.org) taught by [Chris Callison-Burch](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/) I was TA'ing. He asked if I could take a look at an assignment [Lara Martin](https://laramartin.net) made for her [Principles of AI class at UMBC](https://laramartin.net/Principles-of-AI/), and if I could turn the open-ended report-based assignment into a more structured, autograded version. After a quick first attempt, I said "no, this seems hard". But then, I did the unthinkable... I *re-visited the course material* and realized that it was totally doable! So, for most of 2024, I have been developing a new homework assignment for Penn's flagship AI course. I'm glad to say that after releasing it as an optional assignment this past semester, it is now part of CIS 4210/5210 -- one of the highest enrollment courses at Penn! The premise is this...

Luke Skywalker is stuck somewhere in a cave system, and R2-D2 is going to try to rescue him. The cave system consists of a bunch of rooms (in a grid). Luke is in one of those rooms, but each room might also contain a pit or a Wampa (a big scary monster). If R2 runs into a pit or a Wampa, game over, but since it is dark in the caves, R2 can't see what is in a room before moving there. That means that R2 has to rely on other things he can perceive in the caves to infer whether a room is safe or dangerous. In lieu of re-writing the entire problem here, invite you to visit [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/Joseph-Willem-Ricci/wampa-world) to check out the README and maybe even give the assignment a shot yourself! Here is a peek into `agent.py`, where the students have to program their solutions.

        representing possible pit rooms, and wampa_room is a tuple representing
        a possible wampa room.

        Since the goal is to combinatorially enumerate all the possible worlds
        (pit and wampa locations) over the set of rooms that could potentially
        have a pit or a wampa, we first want to find that set. To do that,
        subtract the set of rooms that you know cannot have a pit or wampa from
        the set of all rooms. For example, you know that a room with a wall
        cannot have a pit or wampa. A world with no pits or wampas is
        represented by (frozenset({()}), ())

        Then use itertools.combinations to return the set of possible worlds,
        or all combinations of possible pit and wampa locations.

        You may find the utils.flatten(tup) method useful here for flattening
        wampa_room from a tuple of tuples into a tuple.
